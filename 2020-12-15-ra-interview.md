# RA interview

Prof. Matt Wright and his group are working on a research effort funded by NSF and we need a research assistant. 

Machine Learning and Internet Mapping

In this project, we are leveraging deep learning (DL) models such as CNNs to map Internet routing to identify potentially malicious networks as well as to help circumvent censorship.

We are looking for a graduate student who will be responsible for:

Process BGP data to feed into a DL model.
Train and tune the model to infer BGP routes.
Design and run experiments for different use cases.
The Position

- A committed grad or undergrad student is needed.

- The student will work primarily w/ a Ph.D. student.

Requirements

-  Strong programming skills in Python
-  Strong AI/deep learning skills
-  Good communication skills and teamwork
-  Good knowledge of computer networks
Desirable

Interest in cybersecurity research & development
Strong knowledge of BGP

# RA interview 
Q: BGP?
Q: interest in Security? 
Q: What did you learn in IS? (deep learning experience)
Q: What is the difference between CNN and RNN? 
A: CNN : good at remember local context(using max pooling, sequential data), not good at memorizing past info / RNN : good at memorizing past info
Q: technical skills?
Q: research interests?

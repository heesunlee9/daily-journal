All input will be from standard input and output to standard output, as described in each assignment. In particular, the input/output does not come from/go to a file! You must not provide any prompting or print anything else on standard output. Note that on most operating systems, you can redirect the contents of a file to appear on standard input, such as java MyProg < inputfile. This way you can test your code by including your input in a file and having it appear as if someone typed it on their keyboard

p15
Calculus and matrix algebra, the tools of control theory, lend themselves to systems that
are describable by fixed sets of continuous variables, whereas AI was founded in part as a way
to escape from the these perceived limitations.
...
Minsky was later to prove influential theorems showing the limitations of neural network research.

p17
Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds, built the
first neural network computer in 1950.
...
Why couldn’t all the work done
in AI have taken place under the name of control theory or operations research or decision
theory, which, after all, have objectives similar to those of AI? Or why isn’t AI a branch
of mathematics? The first answer is that AI from the start embraced the idea of duplicating
human faculties such as creativity, self-improvement, and language use. None of the other
fields were addressing these issues. The second answer is methodology. AI is the only one
of these fields that is clearly a branch of computer science (although operations research does
share an emphasis on computer simulations), and AI is the only field to attempt to build
machines that will function autonomously in complex, changing environments.

p19
John McCarthy- 1958 - Lisp, time sharing 

Also in 1958, McCarthy published a paper entitled Programs with Common Sense,
in which he described the Advice Taker, a hypothetical program that can be seen as the first
complete AI system.

p24
These so-called connectionist models of intelligent systems were seen by some as di-
rect competitors both to the symbolic models promoted by Newell and Simon and to the

logicist approach of McCarthy and others (Smolensky, 1988).

p25
As occurred with
the separation of AI and cognitive science, modern neural network research has bifurcated
into two fields, one concerned with creating effective network architectures and algorithms
and understanding their mathematical properties, the other concerned with careful modeling
of the empirical properties of actual neurons and ensembles of neurons.

- Soon after that came a period
called the “AI Winter,” in which many companies fell by the wayside as they failed to deliver
on extravagant promises.
